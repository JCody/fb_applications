<strong>PART ONE - INTRODUCTION</strong>
<br><br>
“Always enwrapped in the illusory mists, always touching the evasive clouds, the peaks of the Great Smoky Mountains are like some barren ideal, that has bartered for the vague isolations of a higher atmosphere the material values of the warm world below.”
<br><br>
“The Prophet of the Great Smoky Mountains,” an 1885 novel by Mary N. Murfree, writing under the pen name Charles Egbert Craddock.
<br><br>
<strong>What is Clingmans Dome?</strong>
<br><br>
A “dome” in Smoky Mountain vernacular is a “rounded mountain or ridge top.” This particular dome is 6,643 feet tall, the highest point in the Great Smoky Mountains and the third highest summit east of the Mississippi River.
<br><br>
The seven-mile-long road to the Clingmans Dome trailhead starts just south of Newfound Gap and reaches elevations of over 6,000 feet. Harsh winter weather at these elevations causes the road to be closed from December 1 through March 31. From the end of Clingmans Dome Road a paved, but very steep trail leads 0.5 mile to a concrete observation tower at the top of the dome. During good weather the view from the tower encompasses a seemingly endless sea of mountain ridges and valleys.
<br><br>
<strong>Welcome to Clingmans Dome, the real  “Top of Old Smoky!”</strong>
<br><br>
This storied mountain reaches 6,643 feet above sea level and is the highest mountain in Great Smoky Mountains National Park. By benefit of straddling the boundary line between the two states, Clingmans Dome is the highest peak in Tennessee and the third highest in North Carolina (and also the East). It holds the distinction of being the highest point along the Appalachian Trail, a 2,174-mile footpath that runs from Georgia to Maine.
<br><br>
Although it is a relatively short walk of one-half mile from the parking lot to the observation tower at the summit, some orientation and preparation is recommended before setting out.
<br><br>
On clear days, the observation tower provides a panoramic view of 360 degrees and offers a look at the whole of the Great Smoky Mountains and beyond, including into seven states. On other days the ridges are shrouded in mist and covered in fog, giving the impression from a distance of a mountain island in a sea of clouds. At still other times, the dome itself stands in the clouds, offering views only of vapor.
<br><br>
Visitors should be ready for weather variances. The summit gets around 85 inches of precipitation annually, which is rainforest proportions. Snowfalls occur as late as May and as early as October. No matter what time of year, it definitely will be cooler than lower elevations. Having gear available like a rain poncho, cap, sweatshirt , sunglasses and sunscreen is advised. A coat, gloves, scarf and hat come in handy in spring and fall.
<br><br>
Proper footwear with ankle support and good traction, like hiking boots or athletic shoes, is recommended.
<br><br>
The trail to the summit is paved, but steep, gaining 330 feet in elevation in a half-mile. It takes most people about 30 minutes to get to the top, but set a <br>comfortable pace that suits individual requirements. 
<br><br>
Those with heart conditions and ailments aggravated by exertion and elevation should be especially cautious. Allow time to stop and rest, and use these breaks to observe the surroundings and read this booklet. 
<br><br>
High levels of ground level ozone and other forms of air pollution are sometimes experienced during summer, which can pose a threat for the elderly, children and people with asthma and breathing difficulties. People with respiratory problems will want to pay special attention to the air quality index reported for this area at park visitor centers, and limit outside exposure accordingly.  
<br><br>
Stay on the paved trail. Do not climb on the rock outcroppings. 
<br><br>
The trailhead is at the far-end of the parking loop. A water fountain, bulletin boards and information signs are here to help further orient visitors. Restrooms are located to the right and an observation circle is to the left. Don’t forget your camera!
<br><br>
<strong>PART TWO – TERRAIN, GEOLOGY AND GEOGRAPHY</strong>
<br><br>
 “Away out yonder beyond the mighty bulk of Clingmans Dome, which, black with spruce and balsam, looked like a vast bear rising to contemplate the northern world, there streaked the first faint, nebulous hint of dawn.”
<br><br>
“Our Southern Highlanders,” by Horace Kephart, published 1913.
<br>	<br>
From the observation circle located to the left of the trailhead are views of the surrounding landscape that characterize much of Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Rows of ridges rise up on steep mountainsides with rugged terrain, which hold ancient geology and a wide range of ecosystems.
<br><br>
Clingmans Dome is the highpoint of the main ridgeline of the Great Smoky Mountains of eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina. The Smokies, as they are commonly known, are part of the Appalachian mountain chain that runs from northern Alabama to the Quebec province of Canada, and are part of the Blue Ridge Mountains that stretch from Georgia to southern Pennsylvania. 
<br><br>
On these ridges water will seep from a spring and begin a steady descent. Joined by water from similar springs, the gathering flow forms rivulets that combine and increase in size. These streams chisel through narrow coves, known locally as “hollows,” to become tributaries of larger creeks and rivers. The origins of several Smokies watersheds begin on the slopes of Clingmans Dome: Little River on the Tennessee side; Forney, Noland and Deep creeks on the North Carolina side. 
<br><br>
The watersheds seen from the observation circle will flow into the Little Tennessee River, impounded near the southwest corner of the park by Fontana Dam. All water flowing from the Smokies ends up in the Gulf of Mexico.
<br><br>
These ridges usually have a covering of deep organic soil, but rock outcroppings at the parking lot and along the trail indicate what usually lies hidden below the surface. The Great Smoky Mountains are made up of layers of rock, one upon another. The layers were formed from a mixture of sandstone, siltstone and shale that rested on an ocean floor over 545 million years ago, then turned into rock by extremely high temperatures and pressure. The bedrock that underlies southeast Tennessee and southwest North Carolina is called the Ocoee Supergroup by geologists, who make further distinctions by creating group subdivisions based on a geographic location and rock types.  The bulk of the park is underlain by the Great Smoky Group.  <br><br>
The other two groups of the Ocoee Supergroup are the Snowbird Group and the Walden Creek Group. Each group in turn consists of formations. Geologists have divided the rocks underlying the Great Smoky Mountains into 20 different named formations. 
<br><br>
Clingmans Dome and the rest of the Great Smoky Mountains were formed by two or three episodes of mountain building in the Paleozoic era. The final episode was a collision of continental plates about 300 million years ago. When the continental plates collided, it caused uplift, folding, and, faulting of the bedrock to form mountains that may have been three times as high as they are today. Water, ice and snow, vegetation and chemical dissolution continuously wear away the mountains. Erosion continues at a rate of an inch every thousand years.  Throughout geologic time there has been a constant battle between uplift and erosion. <br><br>
Many scientists believe that about 260 million years ago the Smokies and the rest of the Blue Ridge Mountains were above sea level and have remained so until this day. 
<br><br>
The very coarse-grained gray rocks seen in the towering outcrops at the trailhead are metamorphosed graywacke (a dirty sandstone) and conglomerate of Thunderhead Sandstone. Look for veins of white quartz that cross cut the rock and embedded blue quartz pebbles in the conglomerates that characterizes the Thunderhead. Another geologic phenomenon that can be seen on some of the rocks is concentric circles that can measure a foot across. These shallow bowl-like depressions were formed when calcium carbonate minerals in the rock weathered quicker than the non-calcareous parts of the rock. This process is known as differential weathering. 
<br><br>
Metasandstone (metagraywacke) and metaconglomerate emerge along the trail.  Both were formed from sediment consisting of sand, pebbles and mud deposited in a basin on an ancient ocean floor. <br>
They are more weathered than the previous outcrops and this gives a different textured look. 
<br><br>
<strong>PART THREE – THE NATURAL HABITAT</strong>
<br><br>
 “In this park we shall conserve the pine, the redbud, the dogwood, the azalea, the rhododendron, the trout and the thrush for the happiness of the American people. The old frontier that put the hard fiber in the American spirit and the long muscles on the American back, lives and will live in these untamed mountains to give future generations a sense of the land from which their forefathers hewed their homes.” 
<br><br>
From the dedication speech given at Newfound Gap by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on September 2, 1940.
<br>	<br>
Despite its southeastern United States location, the environment of Clingmans Dome more closely resembles that of an eastern Canadian spruce-fir forest. 
<br><br>
That is the result of the high elevation and the Ice Age.
<br><br>
While glaciers never reached as far south as the Smokies, they did affect it. As ice covered most of the northern areas of the continent, the glaciers pushed animal and plant life ahead of its extent. Those plants more accustomed to colder climes were able to survive and even thrive here. As the climate began to warm, the high elevations of the Smokies remained a refuge for those life forms with its cool, damp and fertile environment.  
<br><br>
This is one of the few areas in the world where Fraser fir trees grow wild. They are grown commercially for Christmas trees on private lands elsewhere,  but their natural habitat is only in North Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia in select locations above elevations of 4,500 feet. Unfortunately, few mature Fraser firs remain living here. A tiny insect called the balsam woolly adelgid injects a poison into a host tree as it feeds on its sap. The infested tree loses the ability to absorb nutrients until it weakens and dies. The other dominant evergreen is the red spruce. Both are colloquially known as “balsams.” Red spruce can be easily distinguished from the Fraser fir, which has flat, blunt needles and resin blister on its bark. The red spruce has needles with sharp ends and reddish-brown bark without resin blisters. 
<br><br>
American mountain-ash, which grows only above 5,000 feet elevation, and pin cherry, are common deciduous trees in a spruce-fir forest. At the summit, however, the other species give way until it is an almost pure stand of Fraser fir.
<br><br>
Visitors have witnessed an evolving forest as they gained elevation from either Sugarlands Visitor Center near Gatlinburg, Tennessee or Oconaluftee Visitor Center near Cherokee, North Carolina. Looking down the ridges shows the lowest elevations are dominated by tuliptree, oaks and maples. The lowlands, which dip to 875 feet elevation, hold sourwood, oak, sweetgum, and elm trees that settlers cleared to make way for fields and pastures.
<br><br>
Along the trail is a variety of vegetation. Wildflowers include coneflower, bee balm, spring-beauty, wood-sorrel, pink turtlehead, small purple-fringed orchid, mountain St. John’s wort, Rugel’s ragwort, skunk goldenrod, tyme-leaved bluets, asters, Clingman’s hedge-nettle, tall rattlesnake root. Common here are the otherwise uncommon thornless blackberry bushes. <br><br>
The Minnie-bush is rare: Clingmans Dome and Mount Le Conte are two of the few places where it can be found, almost always on sunny rock outcrops. A distinctive shrub, it superficially resembles a deciduous azalea, with small apricot colored bell-like flowers when it blooms in summer. 
<br><br>
Numerous ferns grow in shade, including northern lady fern and hay-scented fern. Moss and many species of lichens, including the endangered rock gnome lichen, are found. Fungi thrive on decaying logs and moist forest floor. However, that part of the ecosystem is changing with the disruption of the spruce-fir forest. As Fraser firs die, large portions of the forest floor are exposed to increased sunlight. This robs shade-dependant species of valuable habitat. 
<br><br>
An endangered species that makes Clingmans Dome its home is the northern flying squirrel. It makes its appearance at dusk and is occasionally observed gliding from tree to tree using folds of loose skin that it stretches between front and rear legs, like a parachute. <br><br>
More frequently seen are red squirrels, called “boomers” by local folks, which eat the small seeds inside the fir cones. Chipmunks can be seen along the trail and around the parking lot as they scamper about, gathering seeds, berries and bugs. 
<br><br>
Bears sometimes are seen crossing the Clingmans Dome Road and make rare appearances near the parking lot. Of the larger mammals that live in the park, bobcats and red fox are more common around Clingmans Dome, but are seen infrequently, thanks to both being secretive and mostly nocturnal. 
<br><br>
What visitors more readily see are birds. One bird seen often is the Common Raven. Other birds here include the Broad-winged Hawk, Barred Owl, Northern Saw-whet Owl, Hairy Woodpecker and American Robin. 
<br><br>
Dark-eyed Juncos are numerous and easily recognizable by the white flash of tail feathers. Canada Warblers have thrived here as shrubs flourish among the dying trees. Peregrine Falcons once inhabited this area until widespread use of pesticides like DDT nearly wiped out the species in the wild. Thanks to breeding programs and reintroduction efforts, Peregrine Falcons are in the park again and may eventually return to Clingmans Dome.  
<br><br>
Not far from the summit, along the Appalachian Trail, a foot-long earthworm, possibly of a species new to science, was found in 2001 by researchers with Discover Life In America.  DLIA is a collaboration of scientists, educators, students, and volunteers who are working on a long-term project to inventory all forms of life in Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
<br><br>
<strong>PART FOUR - LOGGING</strong>
<br><br>
“At the summit of Clingmans we entered a dim, thickset stand of evergreens smaller than telephone poles. I did not inquire why the growth was different from the majestic forest, brilliant with wild flowers, through which we had ascended. But the memory of that dark and closely growing timber has remained with me all my life. Later I was to learn that it constituted a few acres of second growth and that there are differences between a primeval and a regenerating forest.”
<br><br>
 “Out Under the Sky of the Great Smokies” by Harvey Broome, describing a 1915 hike.
<br><br>
It is not always obvious today, but prior to the creation of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, massive logging took place throughout the mountains. The advent of railroads into the region and mechanized tools allowed timber harvests in remote and steep areas that were previously inaccessible. With increasing national and international demands in the early 20th century, an estimated 2 billion board feet of lumber came out of the mills of the Smokies during the timber boom.
<br><br>
An initial phase of logging from 1880 to 1900 was largely selective cutting on a small scale, taking only the largest and most accessible hardwoods. By the 1920s, however, wholesale clearing of the forest was the norm. This practice continued unabated, exhausting large portions of woodland, until the creation of the park.
<br><br>
It was a time of dramatic change in the southern mountains. Steam engines worked alongside draft horses. Towns with thousands of residents sprang up and disappeared just a few years later. Temporary logging camps put workers closer still to their jobs. Shay and Climax locomotives wrestled loads of tuliptree, maple and oak out of the mountains using narrow gauge railroads. Smaller steam engines, called “donkey engines,” powered cranes, booms and loaders, as well as cable conveyers. 
<br><br>
On the North Carolina side of the Smokies, Norwood Lumber Company cut timber in the Forney Creek watershed with rail service almost to the peak of Clingmans Dome. The lumber company extended a narrow gauge railroad line connecting to the Southern Railway along the Little Tennessee River. 
<br><br>
With help from an incline railway, tracks ran to about the 6,000 foot elevation, with spurs concluding at Andrews Bald and near where the parking lot is today. There was particular interest in the spruce-fir forest of Clingmans Dome. Spruce wood was used by Champion Fibre Company for its process of papermaking at its Canton, N.C. mill. The wood’s light weight and relative strength also made it valuable for airplane construction during World War I. [Good photo in archives of this area clearcut]
<br><br>
On the Tennessee side, the Little River Lumber Company conducted massive timber operations and built “Camp 19” for workers on the headwaters of the East Prong of the Little River just below Clingmans Dome.
<br><br>
The effects of logging went beyond the denuding of the forest. Unlike naturally occurring fires which can be part of a healthy forest, the fires that followed logging had no growing trees as fuel and burned underbrush, the forest floor, and remnant debris, creating a scorched earth effect. 
<br><br>
Such detrimental effects gave proponents of a national park in the Eastern USA an additional reason for bringing the Great Smoky Mountains under federal protection. The national park was authorized by Congress in 1926 and established in 1934.
<br><br>
A hike to Clingmans Dome in August 1934 played a key role in the formation of The Wilderness Society. Avid outdoorsman and forester Robert Marshall and local attorney Harvey Broome talked as they walked to the summit about the need for organized wilderness conservation efforts. The following month in Knoxville, Tennessee the men met again, joined by forester Bernard Frank and Appalachian Trail founder Benton MacKaye. 
<br><br>
They decided to create the Wilderness Society, which became officially established in 1935. Broome went on to be a long-serving president. The Wilderness Society was the driving force behind the Wilderness Act of 1964, which required the federal government to preserve areas where “the earth and its community of life are untrammeled by man, where man himself is a visitor who does not remain.” Today, the conservation group continues to work for protecting and restoring wilderness areas of America.
 <br><br>
<strong>PART FIVE – THE CHEROKEE</strong>
<br><br>
“To me, this region is the top of the whole world – the land of the Sky People, it was said. The skyline is in all directions and close at hand. It is a land of cold rushing rivers, small creeks, deep gorges, dark timber, and waterfalls. Great billowing clouds sail upon the mountains and in early morning a blue-gray mist hangs just above the treetops.”
<br><br>
“The Path to Snowbird Mountain: Cherokee Legends” by Traveler Bird, 1972.
<br><br>
The original inhabitants of the region, the Cherokee, called Clingmans Dome “Kuwahi,” which means “mulberry place.” The mountain was a sacred place for the native people and it played an important part in their history and folklore.
<br><br>
Anthropologist James Mooney researched Cherokee culture in the latter part of the 19th century and published “Myths of the Cherokee” in 1900. Mooney wrote that the Cherokee believed bears had their townhouse inside Clingmans Dome. Bears would congregate and hold dances here in the fall before retiring to their dens for the winter. Nearby was the enchanted lake of Attagahi, where wounded bears could submerge in the water and be cured of their injuries when they emerged. 
<br><br>
The animals kept the lake invisible to hunters, but if a human were to sharpen his spiritual vision by prayer, fasting, and all-night vigil, there was a slight chance they might catch a glimpse of Attagahi at daybreak. The lake would appear as a wide but shallow body of purple water, fed by springs flowing from high cliffs. Paw prints of all the bears that had visited would be impressed in the sands along the shore. Fish and reptiles teemed in the water and a multitude of birds flew constantly overhead.
<br><br>
In the earliest times, according to Cherokee lore, the beasts, birds, fishes, insects and plants could all talk. Mooney recorded that the early Cherokee believed all living things originally lived together in peace and friendship until mankind increased so rapidly that their settlements spread over the whole earth, crowding the animals. Man invented weapons and began to kill the larger animals for their flesh and skins, and hurt the smaller creatures carelessly under foot. It was then that the animals decided to work together for their common well-being and exclude the humans. The bears held the first species-exclusive council meeting at Kuwahi, with the wise and mystical White Bear presiding.
<br><br>
All of the southern Appalachians were once the Cherokee homeland. In the 1800s the increasing westward movement of white settlers, coupled with fraudulent treaties with state and federal governments and the discovery of gold in Georgia, led to an escalation of conflicts. At his inauguration, President Andrew Jackson presented a plan for the removal of Native Americans to western territories (now Oklahoma) and in 1830 Congress passed the Indian Removal Act. 
<br><br>
In May 1838, Federal troops and state militias began a brutal roundup of the Cherokee for a forced march, now known as “The Trail of Tears,” to unknown western territories. About 1,000 people managed to elude the deportation, with nearly 500 hiding in the remote wilderness around Clingmans Dome. 
<br><br>
With help from a white trader named William Holland Thomas, they were able to buy back a small portion of their ancestral homeland and negotiate to stay. They eventually gained official recognition in 1866 as the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians and established a tribal government in 1868.
<br><br>
Today, their descendants continue to live on the Qualla Boundary, which borders Great Smoky Mountains National Park in western North Carolina. 
 <br><br>
<strong>PART SIX – THE SUMMIT</strong>
<br><br>
“And over these splendid slopes, one sees in imagination the protecting arm of the new national park reach out, as it soon will, to save them forever from the power of the destroyer.”
<br><br>
“The Carolina Mountains,” by Margaret W. Morley, published 1913 
<br><br>
The Clingmans Dome Trail concludes at the summit where a ramp spirals to the observation tower.  Close by is the U.S. Geological Survey marker that officially designates the exact spot measured as 6,643 feet above sea level.
<br><br>
This is Clingmans Dome, the highest peak in the Great Smoky Mountains and third highest summit east of the Mississippi River.
<br><br>
Early settlers called the peak Smoky Dome.  “Smoky” for the effect of fog and clouds on the mountaintop, “Dome” for its somewhat rounded appearance, like a dome roof on a building. It was named Clingmans Dome in 1858 for an Asheville, N.C. attorney and politician who helped conduct scientific explorations in the region. 
<br><br>
Thomas Lanier Clingman (1812-1897) served in the North Carolina House of Commons, the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate before the Civil War. He also made extensive explorations and scientific inquiries in the Southern mountains and promoted the region for business and tourism. Clingman gained notoriety when he became embroiled in a dispute with another explorer, Elisha Mitchell, about which peak in the Black Mountains of North Carolina was the highest and who had “discovered” it. The controversy was played out in newspapers and in academic debate of the day. 
<br><br>
In fact, Clingman and Mitchell had measured the same mountain, known to local inhabitants as Black Dome. In 1835 Mitchell, a University of North Carolina professor, made measurements and declared Black Dome to be the highest in the Eastern USA. But in 1844, after conducting numerous other measurements in the region, he changed his mind and claimed another peak in the Black Mountains was actually taller. That same year, Clingman published that he had measured Black Dome and believed it to exceed all others in the Appalachians.
<br><br>
In 1857, Mitchell went to verify his measurements in an attempt to settle the dispute. While traveling alone on the mountain, Mitchell fell to his death as he made his way around a waterfall. Had he lived he might have concluded that his initial findings – and Clingman’s – were correct. Regardless, Clingman did not stand in the way when it was proposed to rename Black Dome as Mount Mitchell in memory of the deceased professor. At 6,684 feet, Mount Mitchell is the highest mountain east of the Mississippi. Along the ridge that crests with Mount Mitchell, a promontory rise of 6,520 feet is named Clingmans Peak. 
<br><br>
Clingman then turned his attention to the more western mountains, called “the Great Iron or Smoky Mountains” in the first official reference by the federal government in 1789. Of particular interest to him was the imposing and impressive Smoky Dome.
<br><br>
In 1858, Clingman hired Robert Collins, a local guide, to take an exploratory team into the Great Smoky Mountains. The group would include Clingman and geographer and naturalist Samuel Buckley, who had earlier measured Smoky Dome and surrounding peaks. Most importantly was the addition of Princeton professor Arnold Guyot, known for his precise barometric readings and (for the time) accurate altitude measurements.
<br><br>
It would be Guyot, upon conclusion of the mission and subsequent mapping of the region, who would bestow “Clingmans Dome” upon the previous “Smoky Dome,” in honor of his benefactor and leader of the expedition.
<br><br>
Early explorers like Mitchell, Clingman and Guyot often made their way without established routes. Today, hikers have a maintained trail system throughout the park. To the left of the summit circle is a trail junction for the Appalachian Trail and the Mountains-To-Sea Trail. 
<br><br>
The Appalachian Trail is a National Scenic Trail, part of the National Park system and one of the most famous trails in the world. The trail traverses Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina and Georgia. The Appalachian Trail Conference, a nonprofit support organization, estimates up to 4 million people will hike a portion of the Appalachian Trail annually. Only a small fraction of those hikers will complete the entire Appalachian Trail. Since 1936, nearly 8,000 complete hikes have been recorded, some in a singular attempt called “through hikes.” 
<br><br>
The Appalachian Trail began with Massachusetts planner Benton MacKaye’s idea to establish a trail along the crests of the Appalachian Mountains for recreational hiking and personal renewal. Developed by volunteers, a continuous Appalachian Trail opened in 1937 and was designated as the first National Scenic Trail by the National Trails System Act of 1968. The Appalachian Trail bisects the length of Great Smoky Mountains National Park for 71.4 miles. This section holds the longest continuous height to confront hikers – 34 miles above 5,000 feet. The trail doesn’t actually cross the summit of Clingmans Dome, but passes close by on the northwest side of the mountain at 6,625 feet elevation.
<br><br>
The Mountains-To-Sea Trail begins near the summit. When completed it will extend more than 900 miles through North Carolina to the Atlantic Coast.	 
<br><br>	 
<strong>PART SEVEN – ATOP THE TOWER</strong>
<br><br>
 “The top of the Dome bore as heavy a stand of spruce and balsam as we had ever seen. There was not a single spot from which to see out.”

“Backpacking Was the Only Way” by Paul M. Fink, about a July 22, 1927 hike.

For many years, visitors to the summit found they literally could not see the forest for the trees. Despite the lofty height of Clingmans Dome, views of the surrounding mountains were obstructed.

After establishment of the park, the Civilian Conservation Corps built a wooden-framed, enclosed tower in the 1930s. The Civilian Conservation Corps was another of the New Deal programs of the Franklin D. Roosevelt administration that would have a tremendous impact on the newly created national park. <br><br>
The CCC, as they were commonly known, were unemployed men between 18 to 25 years old who worked for $30 a month in forestry and conservation. In a nation suffering a catastrophic economic depression, the CCC put thousands of young men to work in the Smokies building trails, campgrounds, bridges, and fire towers.  
<br><br>
The CCC tower was replaced in 1960 with this 45-foot circular observation deck. A panoramic vista of 360 degrees and sight distances ranging to 100 miles are possible on clear days. Look to the southwest and the large body of water that appears is Fontana Lake, created by a dam built in 1944 across the Little Tennessee River. It is part of the Tennessee Valley Authority, another Roosevelt program, established for flood control and electricity production that continues today. Property sandwiched between the rising lake and Great Smoky Mountains National Park was bought and made a part of the national park.

To the northeast, the ribbon of highway that meanders in and out of view is the Blue Ridge Parkway. Mount Mitchell, the highest mountain east of the Mississippi, is faintly visible on the clearest of days. Immediately in front of the observation deck are two steel frame towers; one is a communications tower, the other is a climatic data collection tower. To the west are the Chilhowee Mountains in eastern Tennessee and Knoxville, the largest city neighboring the Smokies.

Unfortunately, there are numerous threats to the Great Smokies that are all too visible from Clingmans Dome. Especially during summer, air pollution reduces views by as much as 80%. Pollution causes colors to appear washed out and obscures distant landmarks. <br>
The main cause of the haze is sulfates emitted from coal burning power plants, some as far away as Indiana, Mississippi, and Missouri. To reduce pollution and gain back our beautiful mountain views, we need to cut down on our burning of fossil fuels or find cleaner, more efficient ways to use them.

The seasons are experienced differently at this elevation. Spring reaches the upper elevations later than it does the forests below, with snowfall and flurries routinely occurring into April. In summer, wildflowers will bloom here long after others of the same species at lower elevations have come and gone. <br><br>
In autumn and its procession of fall colors, this is one of the most popular spots for visitors. Winter is the least visited time but still a vibrant season. While the tower is open all year, Clingmans Dome Road is closed to vehicular traffic from December 1 through March 31. Cross country skiing and snowshoes are popular ways to reach the tower when snow is deep.

The tower is something that Thomas Lanier Clingman would have appreciated when he camped here in 1858. He watched the thick mist roll through the spruce and fir at daybreak as his companions set up their scientific instruments and stoked the fire for breakfast. His vision was more figurative than literal, his thinking that this mountain could be a place of escape, its isolation providing a restorative and healthy place for seekers. In a sense, his speculations and dreams came true, though perhaps more successfully than he could ever have envisioned.

The expanse of Great Smoky Mountains National Park, and the wild world protected by it, spreads out from this vantage.
